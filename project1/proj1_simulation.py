"""CSC111 Project 1: Text Adventure Game - Simulator

Instructions (READ THIS FIRST!)
===============================

This Python module contains code for Project 1 that allows a user to simulate an entire
playthrough of the game. Please consult the project handout for instructions and details.

You can copy/paste your code from the ex1_simulation file into this one, and modify it as needed
to work with your game.
